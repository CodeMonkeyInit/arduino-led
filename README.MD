# Arduino Adressable LED quick and dirty implementation

## How to use

1. Install Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
2. Add FastLed (I used 3.4.0, you can try newer version but I can't guarantee that it will work) library using "Manage Libraries" in Arduino IDE.
3. Open sketch in Arduino IDE
4. Upload sketch to your Arduino device
5. Have fun modifying it!
